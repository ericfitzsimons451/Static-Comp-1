# About

### This project was my first chance to use CSS Grid and work with media queries to create a responsive website.  Mod 1 Turing Students are tasked with recreating the layout while making the content fun for themselves.

# Future Iterations
- Center the images better in the media queries.
- Make spacing on tiles between icons and text uniform.
- Add hover states
